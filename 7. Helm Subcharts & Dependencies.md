A subchart is a helm chart that is a dependency of another chart.

Parent Chart → Umbrella chart

Child Chart → Sub chart

- Each sub charts has its own Chart.yaml, values.yaml and templates
- Its deployed together with the parent chart
- Can be enabled/disabled independently

In Chart.yaml:

```
dependencies:
  - name: redis
    version: 17.0.0
    repository: "https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami"
```

Then:
```
helm dependency update
```
