## **📌** Helm lifecycle

**Helm works in a very clean workflow:**

1. **helm install** – render templates → apply to cluster
2. **helm upgrade** – update configuration
3. **helm rollback** – undo a bad deployment
4. **helm uninstall** – remove all resources

**No manual YAML edits — everything is declarative and versioned.**

## 📌 **Helm Install**

**Let’s install the sample chart we created earlier.**

```
helm install myapp ./myapp
```

**To verify the resources created:**

```
kubectl get all
```

---

## 📌 **Viewing a Release**

**Every install becomes a release. To list releases:**

```
helm list
```

**A release stores version history, values, and rendered manifests.**

---

## 📌 **Overriding Values at Install Time**

**Now let’s override something — like replicaCount.**

```
helm install myapp ./myapp --set replicaCount=3
```

**Or using a file:**

```
helm install myapp ./myapp -f values-prod.yaml
```

---

## 📌 **Helm Upgrade**

**To update something, we use upgrade.**

Edit `values.yaml`

Change the replicaCount from 1 → 2

Then run:

```
helm upgrade myapp ./myapp
```

Check pods:

```
kubectl get pods
```

---

## 📌 **Helm Rollback**

**If something goes wrong, rollback is your safety net.**

Check revision history:

```
helm history myapp
```

Rollback:

```
helm rollback myapp 1
```

---

## 📌 **Debugging Tools**

**Debug is one of the most powerful commands in Helm.**

```
helm install myapp ./myapp --dry-run=client --debug
```

**This shows the fully rendered output without applying anything.**

---

## 📌 **Uninstalling**

```
helm uninstall myapp
```

**This removes all Kubernetes resources.**
